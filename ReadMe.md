# SnapCode - a Java workbench for Data Science and Education

SnapCode makes it fast and easy to start coding in Java. SnapCode offers modern IDE coding features, support for
Java REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), and full featured library support for UI, graphics, charting, 3D and more.
All of this makes SnapCode effective for a broad range of uses from data science to education.

SnapCode gets things started quickly with these features:

- Tiny and instant [in-browser download](https://reportmill.com/SnapCode)
- "No Compile" run using Java interpreter
- Incremental REPL style output (shows values for each line as interactive views)

## Modern IDE Features

SnapCode has everything you would expect from a modern IDE to make writing code fast and easy:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Matching symbol highlighting
- Balanced character pair handling for parens/brackets
- Inline compile warnings and errors
- One click access to JRE JavaDoc and source
- Editor shows the AST hierarchy of selected symbol

## Java REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

SnapCode allows you to avoid boilerplate code and evaluates code snippets as you type for instant feedback.

- Class declaration is optional
- Main method declaration is optional
- Variable type declarations are optional
- Statement terminators (semi-colons) are optional
- Direct access to common System methods without preamble (print(), println(), etc.)

Java REPL support is optional - full Java is supported, and can be auto-generated, for when code needs to be
portable and compliant.

## Full Featured Library Support

SnapCode is built using the SnapKit and SnapCharts libraries giving access to advanced application features.
